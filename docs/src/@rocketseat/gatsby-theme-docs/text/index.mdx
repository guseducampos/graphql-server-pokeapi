# Introduction

Welcome to Dex Docs! Here you'll find documentation for the [GraphQL Pokédex Server](https://github.com/jgarrow/graphql-server-pokeapi) that powers our [Pokédex PWA](http://dex.surge.sh/). Whether you want to clone it and use your own instance of the server or you just want to know what query options there are, we've got you covered!

## Playground

To play around with the queries in a playground before cloning or deploying anything, check out our <Link to="/playground">GraphQL Playground</Link>!
