This server uses a SQLite3 database created from the [PokéAPI GitHub repo](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi). If you would like to grab the most up-to-date database or clone your own to host your own server, you'll need to have Python3 installed. If you don't have it already, you can find the download on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Here are some steps if following the instructions on the [PokéAPI GitHub repo](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi) are unclear or aren't working:

1. Clone the [PokéAPI repo](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi) to your computer and open it up in your code editor

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi.git
```

2. \*\*Skip this step if your `pip` and `python` commands are already running on `pip3` and `python3` respectively. If not, you might have to update the scripts -- navigate to `Makefile` at the root of the project. Here, we're going to update all of the script commands to use `pip3` instead of `pip` so that we can use Python3. The updated file should look like this:

```makefile lineNumbers=true
.PHONY: help

help:
	@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?# .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?# "}; {printf "\033[36m%-30s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'


install:  # Install base requirements to run project
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt

dev-install:  # Install developer requirements + base requirements
	pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt

setup:  # Set up the project database
	python3 manage.py migrate --settings=config.local

wipe_db:  # Delete's the project database
	rm -rf db.sqlite3

serve:  # Run the project locally
	python3 manage.py runserver --settings=config.local

test:  # Run tests
	python3 manage.py test --settings=config.local

clean:  # Remove any pyc files
	find . -type f -name '*.pyc' -delete

migrate:  # run any outstanding migrations
	python3 manage.py migrate --settings=config.local

shell:  # Load a shell
	python3 manage.py shell --settings=config.local

format:  # Format the source code
	black .

format-check:  # Check the source code has been formatted
	black . --check

```

3. Now we can install the requirements

```bash
# this will install all of the required packages and libraries for using PokéAPI
make install
```

4. Start up the Django shell

```bash
# Update the `python` script to use `python3` if necessary
python manage.py shell --settings=config.local
```

5. Run the build script

```bash
from data.v2.build import build_all
build_all()
```

6. The database will be found in the root of the project as `db.sqlite3`. You can now move this database file to your GraphQL Pokédex Server repo! Just replace the `db.sqlite3` file in the server repo (`src/data`) with your new one.
